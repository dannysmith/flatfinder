# FlatFinder

This is a simple ruby app, thrown together in 2 hours, to display properties from FlatLand that are up for grabs in London. It reads from a data file (`file.txt`) that flatland email out every day, filters by my criteria and displays the results in a filterable HTML table.

## Things to Note

* The code is a mess.
* `file.txt` needs to be updated manually, though if I end up looking for a flat for more than a few weeks, I might well set it recieves the email they send out and updates itself. That sounds like it might be complicated, though.
* The full listing is at `/` (here)[http://flatfinder-london.herokuapp.com] and the filter for my specific criteria is at `/danny` (here)[http://flatfinder-london.herokuapp.com/danny].
